This organization houses and maintains programs that are text-based,
primarily, though not exclusively, for the benefit of blind users.
This philosophy is not for everyone, and is not a panacea, but some people
find it preferable to pasting a screen reader on top of a GUI application.
In the context of speech or braille, a simple text dialog can be more efficient.
Most notable among our projects is edbrowse, which is an editor browser
whose interface is fashioned after /bin/ed.
To this end, the organization is also called edbrowse, however,
it contains other text-based applications as well.
Visit each repository for details.
